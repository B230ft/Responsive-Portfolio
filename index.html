      <p>My name is Igor Niyazov. I was born in Russia and moved to America when I was 7 years old.
				I have lived in America most of my life. I went college where I recieved my Bachelors Degree in chemistry.
				I want to learn how to code because I feel like it s the future for the job markets especially in the Seattle area.</p>

      <p>So far, I have learned alot about coding and I am eager to learn more. I am going to be working
				on a portfolio of my works and I hope you will follow me as I continue to learn how to code.
				Check out my portfolio for my previous projects.</p>
